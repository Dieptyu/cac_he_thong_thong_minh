This alarm clock, has a different appearance from the alarm clocks I have seen. It has a rectangular shape, about a hand in length, and is quite heavy to hold. The outside of the watch is a bright yellow hard plastic layer, which is both beautiful and easy to clean. The bottom of the watch, are four round rubber buttons, which are the feet of the watch. It helps the watch stand firmly on the table without slipping.
