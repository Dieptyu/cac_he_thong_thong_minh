This alarm clock has a different appearance from the alarm clocks i've seen in the past. It has a rectangular shape about a hand long and is quite heavy to hold. The watch has a bright yellow hard plastic layer which is both beautiful and easy to clean. The bottom of the watch is four round rubber buttons that are the feet of the watch. It helps the watch stand firmly on the table without slipping.
